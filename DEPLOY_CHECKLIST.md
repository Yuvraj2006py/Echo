# Echo Deployment Readiness Checklist\n\n| Area | Status | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Backend configuration | Green | Strongly typed env loader ensures required secrets and fails fast (ackend/core/settings.py). |\n| API security posture | Green | Security middleware, rate limits, structured logging, readiness probes in place (ackend/main.py). |\n| Database & Supabase | Green | RLS enforced with owner/admin policies and indexes (ackend/db/migrations/003_security_hardening.sql). |\n| CI/CD | Green | GitHub Actions pipeline runs lint, type-check, tests, bandit, pip-audit, Semgrep, Trivy (.github/workflows/ci.yml). |\n| Containerization | Green | Multi-stage Dockerfile with non-root user and healthcheck (ackend/Dockerfile). |\n| Logging & Monitoring | Yellow | Structured JSON logs exist but no external collector or alerting yet. Integrate Sentry/OpenTelemetry + log shipping. |\n| Frontend auth & CSRF | Red | Supabase tokens still persist in browser storage; migrate to HttpOnly cookies + CSRF protection. |\n| Secrets management | Yellow | Ensure Render/Secret Manager provides SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET distinct from service role and rotate regularly. |\n| Incident response | Yellow | Runbook outlines steps; needs runbooks for paging/monitoring integration. |\n
