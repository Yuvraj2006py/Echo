# Echo Security Report\n\n## Fixed Vulnerabilities\n\n1. **High – CWE-942 (Overly Permissive CORS & Missing Security Headers)**  \
   - Code: ackend/main.py:49-193  \
   - Impact: The API previously allowed any origin, lacked HTTPS/HSTS enforcement, and emitted no hardened headers, enabling session hijacking and clickjacking in production.  \
   - Fix: Added typed settings, SecurityMiddleware, TrustedHostMiddleware, strict CORS lists, gzip, body size limits, centralized exception handlers, readiness probes, and structured request logging.\n\n2. **High – CWE-307 (Missing Rate Limiting on Sensitive Endpoints)**  \
   - Code: ackend/core/rate_limiting.py, ackend/routes/* (POST/DELETE handlers)  \
   - Impact: Brute-force writes and analysis spam could exhaust quotas and exploit Supabase limits.  \
   - Fix: Integrated SlowAPI limiter with dedicated write/auth limits, attached middleware, and added regression tests (ackend/tests/test_security.py).\n\n3. **High – CWE-347 (Improper JWT Validation & Credential Mixing)**  \
   - Code: ackend/services/auth.py:15-99  \
   - Impact: Tokens were decoded with the service-role key fallback and without issuer/audience checks, allowing forged tokens if key leaked.  \
   - Fix: Require SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET, enforce exp/iat/sub, verify issuer/audience, and support secure HttpOnly cookie tokens.\n\n4. **High – CWE-284 (Missing Row-Level Security Policies)**  \
   - Code: ackend/db/migrations/003_security_hardening.sql  \
   - Impact: Without enforced RLS, PostgREST clients could read/write other users' data.  \
   - Fix: Enabled and forced RLS across user tables, added owner + admin policies, created supporting indexes, and locked storage bucket access.\n\n5. **Medium – CWE-770 (Unbounded Request Bodies & Lack of Structured Logging)**  \
   - Code: ackend/core/middleware.py, ackend/core/logging.py, ackend/main.py  \
   - Impact: Attackers could send oversized payloads to tie up workers and there was no request tracing.  \
   - Fix: Added body size limiter with 1 MiB cap, per-request IDs, structured JSON logs, and response-time metrics.\n\n## Additional Improvements\n- Multi-stage Docker image with non-root user and healthcheck (ackend/Dockerfile).\n- CI pipeline covering linting, type checks, tests, Semgrep, and Trivy (.github/workflows/ci.yml).\n- Hardened request validation for entry tags (ackend/routes/entries.py).\n- Secure defaults for environment parsing (ackend/core/settings.py).\n\n## Outstanding Risks (Needs Follow-up)\n- **High – CWE-922:** Frontend still relies on Supabase browser sessions (localStorage) for JWTs. Move to backend-issued HttpOnly cookies + CSRF defenses before production.\n- **Medium – CWE-352:** No CSRF protection for cookie-authenticated flows once cookies are enabled; plan double-submit or SameSite=Strict with anti-CSRF tokens.\n- **Medium:** Supabase storage bucket name journal-assets assumed in policy; confirm actual bucket IDs or update migration.\n- **Observability Gap:** No centralized tracing/alerting stack configured; integrate Sentry or OpenTelemetry exporter.\n\n## Test Coverage & Commands\n- Backend unit & security tests: python -m pytest -q --asyncio-mode=auto --cov=backend --cov-report=term-missing  \
  *(Tests not executed in this environment because pytest is not installed; ensure dependencies via pip install -r backend/requirements.txt pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-cov before running.)*\n- Static analysis: uff check backend, mypy backend, andit -r backend -ll, pip-audit -r backend/requirements.txt.\n- Container scan: docker build -f backend/Dockerfile -t echo-backend:latest . then 	rivy image --severity CRITICAL,HIGH echo-backend:latest.\n- Semgrep: semgrep --config p/ci.\n
